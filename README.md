# Simple Game

## Game modes
- Mode 0 = Player controls the green cell around grid to fill then with rocks
- Mode 1 = Player can add or remove rocks while the green cell tries eat the apples
- Mode 2 = Multiplayer versions of modes 0 and 1 (needs backend)


## TODOS
- [ ] Create cell selector to add then into grid
- [ ] Create way to remove cell from grid (only rocks make sense?)
- [ ] Add portal cells?
